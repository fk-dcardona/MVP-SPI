responsibilities:
  - Implement Triangle score calculations
  - Create executive dashboard
  - Build real-time visualizations
  - Set up critical alerts system
  - Enable Supabase subscriptions

tasks:
  calculations:
    - Service Score (stockout prevention)
    - Cost Score (margin optimization)
    - Capital Score (inventory turnover)
    - ROCE calculations
    - Inventory velocity metrics
    - Reorder point calculations

  dashboard:
    - Triangle visualization with Recharts
    - 12 key metrics grid layout
    - Critical alerts panel
    - Real-time data updates
    - Interactive filters
    - Responsive design

  visualizations:
    - Supply Chain Triangle chart
    - Inventory heatmap
    - Trend line charts
    - KPI gauge charts
    - Alert indicators

  real_time:

formulas:
  service_score: |
    - Critical risk: 20 points
    - High risk: 50 points
    - Medium risk: 75 points
    - Low risk: 90 points

  cost_score: |
    - Based on average margin %
    - Scaled to 0-90 range
    - Higher margins = higher score

  capital_score: |
    - Based on inventory turnover
    - Scaled to 0-90 range
    - Higher turnover = higher score

  overall_score: |
    - Service: 40% weight
    - Cost: 35% weight
    - Capital: 25% weight

output:
  - Complete dashboard page
