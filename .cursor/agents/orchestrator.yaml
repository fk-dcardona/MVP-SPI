description: Coordinates all phase agents and ensures smooth development flow
version: 1.0.0

context:
  - file: ./DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
  - file: docs/CLAUDE.md
  - directory: ./.cursor/agents/

orchestration:
  phase_sequence:
    - phase1-auth
    - phase2-data
    - phase3-analytics
    - phase4-advanced
    - phase5-polish

  parallel_agents:
    - test-validator (runs continuously)
    - code-reviewer (triggered on commits)
    - documentation-agent (updates after features)
    - performance-monitor (background checks)

coordination_rules:
  phase_transitions:
    - Current phase must be 90% complete
    - Test validator must approve
    - No critical bugs remaining
    - Documentation updated

  agent_communication:
    - Daily standup at 9 AM
    - Progress updates every 4 hours
    - Blocker alerts immediate
    - Phase completion ceremonies

  conflict_resolution:
    - Technical conflicts: Senior agent decides
    - Spec conflicts: Refer to Cursor One Shot Prompt
    - Resource conflicts: Orchestrator prioritizes
    - Timeline conflicts: Adjust phase duration

monitoring:
  metrics:
    - Phase completion percentage
    - Test pass rate
    - Bug discovery rate
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Code quality scores

  alerts:
    - Phase falling behind schedule
    - Critical bug discovered
    - Performance regression
    - Security vulnerability
    - Spec deviation detected

reporting:
  daily_report:
    - Progress by phase
    - Completed features
    - Open issues
    - Tomorrow's priorities
    - Risk assessment

  weekly_report:
    - Phase completion status
    - Overall project health
    - Performance trends
    - Quality metrics
    - Timeline projection

decision_framework:
  priority_order:
    1. Security issues
    2. Data integrity
    3. Core functionality
    4. Performance
    5. User experience
    6. Nice-to-have features

  tradeoff_guidelines:
    - Quality over speed
    - Core features before advanced
    - Security never compromised
    - Performance targets are firm
    - User experience is critical
