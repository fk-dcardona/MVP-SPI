### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Immediate Value (Inventory + Sales)

**Data Required:**
- Inventory CSV: SKU, Description, Quantity, Unit Cost
- Sales CSV: Date, SKU, Quantity, Revenue

**Value Delivered:**
1. **Instant Calculations**
   - Inventory turnover rates
   - Product-level ROI
   - Days of stock coverage
   - Revenue per SKU

2. **Actionable Alerts**
   - Low stock warnings (<7 days)
   - Overstock identification (>90 days)
   - Slow-moving inventory
   - Fast-moving products

3. **Visual Insights**
   - Top/bottom performers
   - Working capital tied up
   - Opportunity cost analysis

**User Hook:** 
"See which products are making you money and which are draining cash - in seconds"

#### Phase 2: Supplier Intelligence

**Additional Data:**

   - Collaborative forecasting

### Data Collection Methods

#### 1. Manual Upload (Start Here)
```javascript
const dataCollectionFlow = {
  step1: {
    type: 'CSV Upload',
    effort: 'Low',
    value: 'High',
    time: '2 minutes'
  },
  step2: {
    type: 'Template Fill',
    effort: 'Medium',
    value: 'High',
    time: '10 minutes'
  },
  step3: {
    type: 'API Integration',
    effort: 'High',
    value: 'Very High',
    time: 'One-time setup'
  }
}
```

#### 2. Semi-Automated (Week 2)
- Email parsing for POs
- WhatsApp document extraction
- Scheduled CSV uploads
- Google Sheets integration

#### 3. Full Automation (Month 1+)
- ERP integrations
- Bank API connections
- Real-time data sync
- Supplier portals

### Gamification Elements

#### Progress Tracking
```typescript
interface DataCompleteness {
  level: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
  percentage: number
  missingDataTypes: string[]
  potentialInsights: string[]
  estimatedValue: number
}
```

#### Achievement System
- 🏆 "First Insight" - Upload first dataset
- 🎯 "Optimizer" - Reduce overstock by 20%
- 🚀 "Fast Mover" - Identify 5 fast-moving SKUs
- 💎 "Premium Analyst" - Complete Level 3 data

### Technical Implementation

#### Progressive Enhancement Component
```typescript
interface ProgressiveDataPrompt {
  currentLevel: number
  nextDataType: string
  valueProposition: string
  effortRequired: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High'
  estimatedTime: string
  exampleInsights: string[]
}
```

#### Smart Recommendations
```typescript
class DataRecommendationEngine {
  analyzeCurrentData(data: UserData): DataRecommendation[] {
    // Analyze what insights are possible with more data
    // Prioritize by value/effort ratio
    // Personalize based on industry/size
  }
  
  generateNextStepPrompt(): ProgressivePrompt {
    // Create compelling reason to add more data
    // Show specific value they'll unlock
    // Make it easy with templates/guides
  }
}
```

### Onboarding Flow
