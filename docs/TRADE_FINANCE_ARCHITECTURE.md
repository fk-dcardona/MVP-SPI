# Trade Finance Platform Architecture
## User-Centric Information Model

### Core Mental Models

Users think in terms of **business entities**, not technical features:

```
1. PRODUCTS (What we sell/buy)
   └── Performance Metrics
       ├── ROI by Product
       ├── Sales Velocity
       ├── Margin Analysis
       └── Inventory Turnover

2. CUSTOMERS (Who buys from us)
   └── Relationship Data
       ├── Purchase History
       ├── Payment Terms
       ├── Delivery Locations
       └── Communication Log

3. PROCUREMENT (What we need to order)
   └── Planning Intelligence
       ├── Reorder Points
       ├── Lead Time Analysis
       ├── Seasonal Patterns
       └── Safety Stock Levels

4. SUPPLIERS (Who we buy from)
   └── Performance Tracking
       ├── Delivery Reliability
       ├── Price History
       ├── Exchange Rate Impact
       └── Quality Scores

5. INVENTORY (What we have)
   └── Real-Time Visibility
       ├── Current Stock
       ├── In-Transit Goods
       ├── Committed Inventory
       └── Alert Management

6. FINANCIALS (Money flow)
   └── Cash Flow Intelligence
       ├── Payables Schedule
       ├── Receivables Tracking
       ├── Working Capital
       └── Exchange Risk
```

### The Supply Chain Triangle

The foundation of our value proposition:

```
         SALES
          /\
         /  \
        /    \
       /      \
      /________\
INVENTORY    FINANCE

Key Insight: All business decisions revolve around balancing these three elements
```

### Progressive Value Creation

```

### Data Flow Architecture

```
UNSTRUCTURED DATA SOURCES
├── WhatsApp Messages
├── Email Attachments
├── CSV Uploads
└── API Integrations
          ↓
    [PROCESSING LAYER]
    ├── Document Parser
    ├── Data Validator
    └── Calculation Engine
          ↓
    [INSIGHT GENERATION]
    ├── Real-time Metrics
    ├── Predictive Analytics
    └── Alert Engine
          ↓
    [VALUE DELIVERY]
    ├── Role-based Dashboards
    ├── WhatsApp Notifications
    └── Shareable Reports
```

### Viral Growth Mechanism

```
1. User uploads data → Gets insights
2. Shares specific insight with colleague
3. Colleague sees value → Requests access
4. Adds their data → Network effect multiplies
5. Supplier gets scorecard → Joins platform
6. Creates industry benchmark data
```
